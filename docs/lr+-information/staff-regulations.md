While on-duty, it is mandatory for all staff members to wear an official BloxStreet uniform. Staff members can easily equip a uniform by interacting with a locker and selecting their preferred hoodie or shirt.

  Other information to note:
  *  Failure or refusal to comply with the requirement of wearing an official BloxStreet uniform while on-duty will result in consequences.
  *  BloxStreet merchandise from the group's store is acceptable to wear as part of the uniform, as long as it is up-to-date.

### <font color="#C21807">Guidelines</font>


- Always respect other staff members.
- Do not discriminate against anyone's race, sexuality, gender, religion, ethnicity, etc.
- Maintaining professionalism is required when on-duty and off-duty. Staff members are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times, as their behavior directly reflects the reputation of our group.
- Professionalism must be maintained to a certain degree within the BloxStreet Discord server. Staff members are more than welcome to converse with one another, but all topics must be appropriate and within reason.
- If an LR or MR desires to engage in conversations, take a break while in-game, or order/check out, they should switch to the off-duty mode.
- Staff members should not idle in the middle of the store, but they will not be punished for doing so. If a staff member needs to go idle or take a break, they should respawn in the staff room by resetting their character. HRs are permitted to stand against a wall while AFK.
- Staff members are prohibited from stealing other workers' tills or cash registers.
- Regardless of who may be at fault in a given situation, staff members are expected to refrain from instigating or participating in any form of drama.
- Staff members are required to respect the decisions made by SHRs.
- Administrative actions are considered final. Complaining or openly expressing discontent about administrative actions will lead to consequences.
- Refer to the [Punishment Guide](https://support.bloxstreet.com/hr-information/punishment-guide) for more guidelines.
