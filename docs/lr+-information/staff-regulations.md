While on-duty, it is mandatory for all staff members to wear an official BloxStreet uniform. Staff members can easily equip a uniform by interacting with a locker and selecting their preferred hoodie or shirt.

  Other information to note:
  *  Failure or refusal to comply with the requirement of wearing an official BloxStreet uniform while on-duty will result in consequences.
  *  BloxStreet merchandise from the group's store is acceptable to wear as part of the uniform, as long as it is up-to-date.

- Always respect other staff members.
- Do not discriminate against anyone's race, sexuality, gender, religion, or ethnicity.
- Professionalism must be maintained to a certain degree within the BloxStreet Discord server. Staff members are more than welcome to converse with one another, but all topics must be appropriate and within reason.
- Regardless of who may be at fault in a given situation, staff members are expected to refrain from instigating or participating in any form of drama.
- Staff members are required to respect the decisions made by Group Administrators and Group Directors.
- Administrative actions are considered final. Complaining or openly expressing discontent about administrative actions will lead to consequences.
- Maintaining professionalism is required when on-duty (!startwork) and off-duty (!stopwork). Staff members are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times, as their behavior directly reflects the reputation of our group.
- If an LR or MR desires to engage in conversations, take a break while in-game, or order/check out, they should switch to the off-duty mode.
- Staff members should not idle in the middle of the store, but they will not be punished for doing so. If a staff member needs to go idle or take a break, they should respawn in the staff room by resetting their character. HRs are permitted to stand against a wall while AFK.
- Assistant Store Managers and Store Managers have access to moderator commands. Store Directors, Executive Assistants, and Store Executives have access to admin commands. All commands must be hidden. To execute a command privately using the “/e” method, simply open the chat and enter the command as usual. Once entered, place an “/e” before the desired command to ensure it is hidden. Additionally, to access the console, simply press the “;” or “’” key on the keyboard. This action will display a GUI at the top of the screen. Unlike using commands in the chat, the console does not require a prefix before entering the command.
- LRs and MRs have the authority to cuff trollers to ensure a positive player experience. These staff members should reach out to an HR to ban trollers from the server after cuffing them.
- A maximum of one staff member is allowed to assist at the help desk. Staff members are not required to own cuffs to work at the help desk.
- Store Director+ may supervise at the store. A maximum of two HRs may supervise each store department.
- Previously blacklisted and banned individuals, as well as reformed and resigned HRs, are allowed to utilize their points to claim a rank they have not previously acquired.
- Demoted LRs and MRs are permitted to reuse points to claim a rank they have not previously claimed.
- If an LR or MR has been demoted and would like to understand the reasons behind their demotion, they should send a direct message to an HR.
- Staff members are prohibited from stealing other workers' tills or cash registers.

**Resignation Policy:**

Once a staff member resigns, it is considered final. BloxStreet does not offer reranks if a player changes their mind after resigning. As a result, it is strongly advised that players carefully consider their decision to resign, as it is an irreversible action. However, Group Administrators and Group Directors have the possibility to return to BloxStreet under certain circumstances.

**Rank Transfer Policy for Hacked Accounts:**

BloxStreet does not offer rank transfers in cases where an account has been hacked. It is the player’s responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their account. Staff members are held fully accountable for the security of their own accounts. In the event that a staff member’s account has been compromised, it is crucial for them to promptly inform a Group Administrator or Group Director through a ticket.

**Rank Transfer Policy for Deleted Accounts:**

Staff members whose accounts are deleted have the option to transfer their rank to a different account if their ban is deemed false by a Group Administrator+. The Group Administrator+ has the authority to assess whether it is appropriate for an individual’s rank to be transferred to another account when their original account is deleted. BloxStreet acknowledges that Roblox moderation can fall short of complete accuracy, and as a result, the chance to transfer a rank to an alternate account if a main account gets deleted is provided.

**Investigation Policy:**

In the event that a Group Administrator or Group Director is conducting an investigation into a community member, that Group Administrator or Group Director has the authority to temporarily demote the player to the rank of Customer until the investigation is concluded. Furthermore, the Group Administrator or Group Director has the right to remove any Discord roles from the player while the investigation is ongoing. Once the investigation is finalized, the Group Administrator or Group Director will take appropriate action or re-rank the player(s) involved. Moreover, Group Administrators or Group Directors who are conducting investigations have the right to pose questions to the individuals involved, and it is expected that those individuals respond truthfully. However, Group Administrators or Group Directors are not obligated to provide evidence to the players who are undergoing an investigation.

**Plagiarism Policy:**

Intentionally copying official BloxStreet materials, encompassing, but not limited to, our forms, guides, documents, server layout, GFX, and game, may lead to, at the very least, a termination, a staff blacklist, and/or a ban from the BloxStreet Discord server. Neglecting to report such plagiarism despite being aware can also lead to consequences. It is expected that establishments throughout Roblox foster originality, which prohibits the replication of BloxStreet’s resources for personal gain.

**Alternate Account Policy:**

Staff members are allowed to utilize alternate accounts for roleplaying purposes as a Customer, LR, or MR. However, it is strictly prohibited for staff members to attain an HR rank through any means on their alternate accounts. Failure to adhere to BloxStreet’s guidelines while using an alternate account will lead to consequences for both the main and alternate accounts. Furthermore, players who use an alternate account to bypass a blacklist or permanent ban will be permanently banned.

**Refund Policy:**

BloxStreet has a strict no-refund policy for all purchases, regardless of the item or product, including points, in-game cash, and game passes. It is essential to keep this policy in mind before making any purchases.
