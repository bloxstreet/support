  This is a compilation of BloxStreet's punishments. Certain punishments only pertain to staff, while others are applicable to all community members.

### Important Information


- Higher ranks may be subject to more severe punishments.
  - test
- All punishments are subject to change depending on the severity of the community member's actions. Only SHRs may change a punishment from what is listed below.
- Lack of awareness regarding the rules does not exempt an individual from receiving a punishment.
- Staff members who acquire a rank through points are still obligated to adhere to all of BloxStreet's rules. Failure to do so will result in the same disciplinary actions, such as demotions, blacklists, and permanent bans.
- Certain punishments designated for staff members may also be applicable to non-staff.
- Not all punishments are explicitly listed in this document. It is expected that community members exercise common sense.
- Intentional leaking, gossiping, affiliating with gossip, and failing to report gossip are considered unappealable offenses. Apart from these, SHRs hold the authority to designate other offenses as unappealable on a case-by-case basis.
- If an action below does not occur in-game, HRs do not need to server ban the player. For example, if a community member is found simping for an SHR in the Discord server, there should be no server ban.
- HRs may only use the :kick command to update a player's rank in case of a glitch.
