### <font color="#C21807">Trainee Team Member - Senior Team Member</font>

Trainee, Junior, and Senior Team Members must attend training sessions to progress in their ranks. These sessions are hosted multiple times a day, providing LRs with ample chances to earn promotions. The schedule for these training sessions can be accessed in the in-game staff room or [here](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/600732254502780928/1133663177549299794).

### <font color="#C21807">Department Supervisor - Assistant Store Manager</font>

To increase the likelihood of receiving a promotion, Department Supervisors, Department Managers, and Assistant Store Managers should actively participate in [shifts](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/600732254502780928/1133663091784159253), which offer opportunities for these ranks to receive a promotion. Shifts also serve as times for guests to visit the store and have an enjoyable experience. To be promoted, it is crucial to maintain professionalism, utilize proper grammar, and consistently demonstrate dedication. While grammar is not required for any rank, it is necessary in-game if one wishes to be considered for a promotion. Attending shifts and exhibiting exemplary behavior does not guarantee a promotion, as promotions are determined by a combination of factors. Staff members are expected to not complain about not receiving a promotion. Another pathway for a promotion is to be noticed by a Group Administrator or a Group Director outside of a shift. Recommending other staff members is not permitted.

### <font color="#C21807">Store Manager Promotion Guide</font>
To increase your chances of being promoted as a Store Manager at BloxStreet, you must meet several key requirements, including being off cooldown. Store Manager promotions happen at random times. Keep in mind that fulfilling these requirements only improves your chances of a promotion and does not guarantee one.

**Requirement #1 - Activity:**

To be considered for a promotion, Store Managers must spend at least 60 minutes per week **at the store** for a minimum of two consecutive weeks. Training activity is **not** a factor when considering promotions. However, if a Group Administrator or Group Director notices a Store Manager consistently attending trainings, they may pay closer attention to that individual's store activity.  Activity should be consistent and well-distributed. Overworking is not encouraged; Group Administrators and Group Directors value seeing a balance between Roblox and other aspects of your life. While at the store, Store Managers should focus on working in departments rather than going off-duty, cleaning spills, and restocking items, as these activities do not show hard work. Greetings should be unique, and players must demonstrate a solid understanding of BloxStreet's rules and procedures.

**Requirement #2 - Discord Server:**

Store Managers must be in the Discord server to get promoted by a Group Administrator or a Group Director. It is highly recommended that Store Managers assist lower-ranking staff with their questions and provide accurate information. Frequently chatting in the Discord server is required for those aiming for the Store Director position. Participating in events is also beneficial.

**Requirement #3 - Grammar:**

While grammar is not required at the store for any rank, Store Managers must use correct capitalization, punctuation, and spelling (grammar) when playing BloxStreet games to be considered for a promotion. Proper grammar demonstrates professionalism and maturity. Having more than five grammar errors can reduce one's chances of a promotion.

**Requirement #4 - Maturity:**

Maturity is a crucial factor for Group Administrators and Group Directors when making promotion decisions. Immature conversations and erratic behavior will not help one's chances. Constantly discussing your BloxStreet rank is not beneficial, as Group Administrators and Group Directors want to see that you have interests outside of Roblox and a well-rounded life.

**Requirement #5 - Not Hinting or Complaining about the Promotion System:**

Complaining about the promotion system at BloxStreet or hinting may lead to disciplinary actions. Promotions at BloxStreet are relatively easier compared to other groups, so such complaints and hinting suggest a lack of commitment and an overemphasis on one's rank rather than focusing on serving the community and providing excellent service to visitors.

**Common Misconceptions:**

Group Administrators and Group Directors can monitor Store Managers' activity through various platforms and are not required to be in-game. Additionally, some Store Executives have the authority to recommend Store Managers based on several factors.

**Earning Points for HR Ranks:**

Players who aim to earn an HR rank through points may see reduced chances of future promotions and being recommended for special positions. Those who have advanced through hard work over several months are recognized by Group Administrators and Group Directors for their dedication and commitment. Consequently, these individuals are more likely to be selected for higher positions compared to those who achieve ranks quickly through points and without demonstrating the same level of dedication.

### <font color="#C21807">Cooldowns</font>

Some BloxStreet ranks have cooldowns. A cooldown refers to a specific duration during which a player is ineligible to receive a promotion. Players who claim ranks through the points system do not face a cooldown period if they choose to earn their next rank through points. However, Store Managers and HRs who choose not to acquire their ranks through points will be subject to cooldowns. Store Managers can ping or DM an HR to check their cooldown. HRs can ping a Group Administrator or Group Director. Working at the store while on cooldown will increase an individual's chances of a promotion.


| Cooldowns |
|:----------|
| Trainee Team Member: None |
| Junior Team Member: None |
| Senior Team Member: None |
| Department Supervisor: None |
| Department Manager: None |
| Assistant Store Manager: None |
| Store Manager: 2 weeks |
| Store Director: 1 month |
| Executive Assistant: 1 month |
| Store Executive: 3 months |


### <font color="#C21807">Points</font>

Players have the opportunity to rank up by earning points, which can be used to claim a higher rank through the 'Shop' GUI. Staff members can earn two points for each successful restock, one point for working at any department with POS systems, one point for working at the main registers, two points for each spill cleaned, and two points for working at the hotel. Photoshopping evidence or engaging in point cheating is strictly prohibited and will be met with severe consequences. Point cheating includes actions such as using alternate accounts or enlisting friends to remove items from shelves, allowing the staff member to restock them shortly afterward. The specific amount of points required to claim each rank can be found in the list provided below.

| Points |
|:----------|
| Department Supervisor: 1,500 |
| Department Manager: 3,000 |
| Assistant Store Manager: 5,000 |
| Store Manager: 8,000 |
| Store Director: 10,000 |
| Executive Assistant: 15,000 |
| Store Executive: 20,000 |
