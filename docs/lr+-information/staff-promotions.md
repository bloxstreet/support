# Staff Promotions

:::info

This guide outlines all of the necessary information about the promotion process at BloxStreet.

:::

### <font color="#C21807">Trainee Team Member - Senior Team Member</font>

Trainee, Junior, and Senior Team Members must attend training sessions to progress in their ranks. These sessions are hosted multiple times a day, providing LRs with ample chances to earn promotions. The schedule for these training sessions can be accessed in the in-game staff room or [here](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/600732254502780928/1133663177549299794).

### <font color="#C21807">Department Supervisor - Assistant Store Manager</font>

To increase the likelihood of receiving a promotion, Department Supervisors, Department Managers, and Assistant Store Managers should actively participate in shifts and strive to be recognized by a shift host. It is crucial to maintain professionalism, utilize proper grammar, and consistently demonstrate dedication. While Middle Ranks are not required to use grammar, it is necessary in-game if they wish to be considered for a promotion. Attending shifts and exhibiting exemplary behavior does not guarantee a promotion, as promotions are determined by a combination of factors. Staff members are expected to not complain about not receiving a promotion. Another pathway for a promotion is to be noticed by an SHR outside of a shift. Recommending other staff members to an SHR is not permitted.

### <font color="#C21807">Store Manager - Store Executive</font>

When considering promotions from Store Manager to Store Director, as well as promotions within the HR ranks, the administration team takes into account various factors.

To increase the chances of receiving a promotion, Store Managers should be active on all BloxStreet games and its Discord server, consistently utilize proper grammar in-game, display professional behavior, and demonstrate dedication. Promotions for Store Managers are at the discretion of Group Administrator+ and may occur at random times. These promotions are typically more challenging compared to promotions from Department Supervisor to Assistant Store Manager, requiring a greater investment of time and effort. Store Managers must prove to SHRs that they are fully prepared to undertake the responsibilities of an HR role.

> 1.   Store Managers must utilize proper grammar in all BloxStreet games.
> 2.   Store Managers must possess a certain number of characteristics, such as professionalism, maturity, and respect.
> 3.   Having past moderation history will significantly decrease an individual's chances of a promotion to an HR rank. However, past moderation history will not restrict a player from earning an HR rank.
> 4.   Store Managers wishing to receive a promotion should remain active in the BloxStreet Discord server. Talking in channels and attending events does help.
> 5.   Store Managers should work frequently at the store. It is highly recommended to remain consistent with activity. For example, spend an hour at the store each day rather than seven hours one day and then a break for a week. Be sure to work at a department when at the store. Going off-duty, supervising, cleaning spills, or restocking items will not increase an individual's chances of a promotion.
> 6.   Avoid sucking up to SHRs for a promotion. Store Managers may be rank locked from obtaining Store Director if caught simping.
> 7.   Upon encountering a disruptive customer, deal with them calmly and professionally. Refer to the appropriate procedures for handling a disruptive customer.
> 8.   Greetings should be unique and original. Copying and pasting, adding emojis, and using moderate vocabulary is strongly recommended.
> 9.  It is recommended to have current or past experience as an MR+ at a prominent establishment. However, current or past experience is not mandatory.
> 10.  Store Managers wishing to receive a promotion should not idle once or until their cooldown has ended. Store Manager promotions require a great deal of patience and consistency.
> 11.  Grammar in the Discord server does not play a role in promotions.

> Keep in mind that these include only some requirements Store Managers must meet.

### <font color="#C21807">Cooldowns</font>

Some BloxStreet ranks have cooldowns. A cooldown refers to a specific duration during which a player is ineligible to receive a promotion.

|:----------|
| Trainee Team Member: None |
| Junior Team Member: None |
| Senior Team Member: None |
| Department Supervisor: None |
| Department Manager: None |
| Assistant Store Manager: None |
| Store Manager: 2 weeks |
| Store Director: 1 month |
| Executive Assistant: 1 month |
| Store Executive: 3 months |

Working at the store while on cooldown will increase an individual's chances of a promotion.

### <font color="#C21807">Points</font>

Players have the opportunity to rank up by earning points, which can be used to claim a higher rank through the 'Shop' GUI. Photoshopping evidence or engaging in point cheating is strictly prohibited and will be met with severe consequences. The specific amount of points required to claim each rank can be found in the list provided below.
