### Training Behavior and Information


* Trainers should avoid rushing through the script. Provide sufficient time for LRs to read and process the information being presented.
* MRs and HRs should refrain from engaging in conversations and instead utilize the BloxStreet Discord server.
* Engaging in any form of unprofessional behavior will result in immediate dismissal from the session and potential disciplinary actions.
* Although Store Managers are not required to use grammar at the store, they are required to when training LRs. The punishment for HRs lacking grammar also applies to Store Managers in this situation.
* It is acceptable for a trainer to claim another trainer's position if one disconnects prior to the teleportation of LRs.
* LRs are permitted to go AFK for a maximum duration of two minutes, although they must inform their trainer about their temporary absence. LRs are allowed to go AFK only twice per session.
* Under no circumstances is it permitted to falsely inform LRs that they failed and then later state they passed. Please be direct when conveying your intent to pass LRs.

### Host and Co-Host Scripts

This section provides an overview of the responsibilities and duties assigned to the Host and Co-Host, as well as guidelines on what they should say.

### Host and Co-Host: Before Claiming



Prior to the commencement of the training session, it is the responsibility of the Host to find an HR who will be responsible for announcing the training session in all large servers of the store. The Host should ensure that the HR uses the appropriate format when making the announcement.

Between :35 and :40, it is expected that both the Host and Co-Host arrive at the Training Center to prepare for the training session. It is the responsibility of both the Host and Co-Host to ensure they are online and punctual for the session. Failing to attend a claimed session without giving a notice will result in a punishment (if done repetitively).

### Host and Co-Host: Claiming



At :45, which is 15 minutes before the training session begins, the Host should claim the session, while the Co-Host does the first group shout to notify LRs. Simultaneously, the announcer is responsible for making an announcement about the training session in all large servers at the store.

### Host and/or Co-Host: Guide Checking



After claiming the session and before :00, it is important for the Host and/or Co-Host to request trainers to state the three green lines that are found below, ensuring they have access to the correct version of the guide. The Host and/or Co-Host should use the messages below.

**Host and/or Co-Host:** *Hello! Please state all green lines found on the training guide. There are three in total.*


**Host and/or Co-Host:** *Thank you! Please note that the green lines are also used when you are training LRs.*


### Host: Minutes before Commencement



The Host should announce the line below at :57.

**Host:** *We will commence in approximately three minutes. At this time, all LRs are requested to refrain from chatting so that we may begin promptly.*


### Host and Co-Host: Training Commences



At :00, which is the exact time of the training session's commencement, the Host should type the command "/e :slock". The Co-Host should send the second group shout. Once all the LRs have become silent, the Host can proceed to deliver their introduction lines. In the event that any LRs fail to comply with the requirement to remain silent, the Host and Co-Host have the authority to remove them from the server.

**Host:** *Greetings, everyone, and welcome to this training session! You will start your training by watching a presentation on the monitors. For your success, your undivided attention is required.*


**Host:** *Please keep in mind that chatting or distracting others is strictly prohibited at this time and will result in a removal from the server.*


To initiate the presentation, the Host needs to click the 'Host Settings' button located at the bottom left corner of their screen. Afterward, the Host should proceed by clicking the 'Begin' button. In case the 'Host Settings' button is not visible in the bottom left corner, the Host should promptly rejoin the session. The slideshow can only be played once.

**Host:** *The presentation is now underway. For those of you who desire a closer view of the slideshow, simply click on any monitor to zoom in.*


Throughout the presentation, both the Host and Co-Host should actively supervise the LRs to ensure they are adhering to the guidelines. This includes making sure that the LRs are remaining on the red lines and refraining from engaging in conversations with one another. In addition, the Host and/or Co-Host should remove Department Supervisors, Department Managers, and Assistant Store Managers from the session. Lastly, the Host should whitelist all Store Managers by running the commands /e :wl on and /e :wl add (username).

### Host and Co-Host: After Presentation



**Co-Host:** *As the presentation is now finished, you will be teleported to a trainer shortly. Once you are teleported, please refrain from wandering around.*


**Co-Host:** *I wish all of you the best of luck in successfully completing this training session. Trainers should remain patient while LRs are teleported.*


The Co-Host can now proceed to move towards the red lines, while the Host should head to the first occupied station for teleportation. To teleport LRs, the Host should view the Co-Host and bring the LRs. It is important to note that the Host should teleport a minimum of one and a maximum of four LRs to each trainer, depending on the number of trainers available.

Once the Host has successfully completed the teleportation process, they, along with the Co-Host, should start supervising the LRs and trainers. By this point, the Co-Host should have already taken the training attendance.

## Trainer Scripts

This section provides an overview of the tests that trainers are required to perform. In the event that an LR needs to go AFK, trainers should not wait for their return. The maximum AFK duration is two minutes, ensuring that the LR does not miss significant content if the trainer maintains an average pace. Upon the LR's return from being AFK, the trainer should provide a summary of the covered topics and perform any missed tests. However, if all LRs disconnect or fail the training session, the trainer should promptly leave the server without notifying the Host or Co-Host.

### Cafe Test



The first phase of training is the Cafe Test. During this evaluation, LRs will be tasked with preparing an order. It is essential that LRs utilize understandable grammar throughout this test. Trainers must make sure that LRs are well-informed about the beverage machines and how to select each drink using the appropriate cup. For this test, LRs should state their greetings and utilize the POS system. Please keep in mind that it is mandatory to have 'BloxStreet' in a greeting. If an LR misspells 'BloxStreet' during this test, the trainer should prompt the LR to repeat their greeting. If an LR fails to prepare the correct order or misspells/does not include 'BloxStreet' in their greeting more than once, the trainer should state the fail prompt and then remove them from the server, specifying the reason as "Failed."

### Register Test



The subsequent stage of training is the Register Test. During this evaluation, LRs will engage in roleplay, simulating the necessary steps to check out a customer. If any LRs are unsure of how to send a payment request, trainers should take the time to explain the process to them. It is imperative that LRs state a greeting and an outro, inquire about the desired form of payment, and remind the trainer to scan their card, all while employing understandable grammar. If an LR fails to meet these requirements, the trainer should state the fail prompt and remove them from the server, specifying the reason as "Failed."

### Passing LRs



If a group of LRs successfully pass, the trainer should utilize the :ff command on them and take them to one of the designated purple/pink lines in the training room. Subsequently, the Host or Co-Host will rank them before dismissing them from the game. However, if a player disconnects before receiving their rank despite passing the training, trainers should promptly contact an Executive Assistant+ for further assistance.

### Training Process



This section will provide trainers with the training script. It is essential not to modify this script. The use of emojis is permitted.

**The introduction takes place at the cafe station.**

**Trainer:** *Greetings, everyone! Thank you for attending this training session. My name is (username), and it is my pleasure to be your trainer.*


**Trainer:** *In case you need to go AFK for any reason, be sure to inform me. Failure to do so will result in a removal from the server.*


**Trainer:** *Please be aware that you are allowed to go AFK for a maximum of two minutes. You may not go AFK for a duration exceeding this time.*


**Trainer:** *During this training session, you are permitted to go AFK up to two times.*


**Trainer:** *In the event that I disconnect from the server, please wait for me to rejoin. Refrain from moving to a different station or wandering around.*


**Trainer:** *Please indicate you are ready to proceed by jumping. At this time, I will not answer any questions.*


At this point, all LRs are required to jump. If an LR fails to jump in a timely manner, the trainer must remove them from the server. Trainers may not answer questions at this time.


### Cafe Test Script



**This test takes place at the cafe station.**

**Trainer:** *We will now begin with the Cafe Test.*


**Trainer:** *When a customer approaches your cafe register at the store, it is essential to greet them with a polite and friendly greeting.*


**Trainer:** *Here is an example of a greeting: “Hello! Welcome to BloxStreet Corporation! I'm (username), and I'm here to assist you. How may I help you today?”*

**At this point, head back to the trainer spot. Ensure your LRs face you.**

**Trainer:** *To log into a cafe register, simply scan your BloxStreet Staff Card on the screen. You may scan your card at this time.*


**At this point, make sure all LRs are signed into their cafe register.**

**Trainer:** *After signing in, proceed to scan any items the customer has requested. Once all items have been scanned, click on "Finish Transaction" to complete the order.*


**Trainer:** *Afterward, kindly prompt the customer to scan their BloxStreet Cash Card on the payment screen. Once the payment is made, wish the guest an enjoyable rest of their day.*


**Trainer:** *We will begin this test shortly. You must utilize comprehensible grammar, and I will assess your understandability.*


**Trainer:** *Please be aware that I can only repeat the order twice. If you give me an incorrect item, you will fail this training automatically.*


**Trainer:** *I will now approach each of you individually. When I do, make sure to greet me with your greeting.*


**Approach the first LR. Wait for the LR to state their greeting and begin once they do.**

**Trainer:** *Greetings! May I please have a Cherry Slushie and a Regular Coffee?*


**Assist the LR as needed. If the LR provides the wrong order, fail them.**

**If they pass, proceed to the next LR. If they fail, use the line below.**

**Trainer:** *Unfortunately, you have failed this training session due to (reason). You are welcome to attend another session.*




### Register Test Script



**This test takes place at the register.**

**Trainer:** *Congratulations, you have all passed the Cafe Test! Please sign out of your cafe registers by clicking the exit button.*


**Ensure all LRs are signed out of their cafe registers before proceeding.**

**Trainer:** *Follow me so we can start the Register Test. When at the register, form a line facing the register from the cashier point.*


**Trainer:** *When a customer approaches your cash register, similar to the cafe, it is essential to greet them with a polite and friendly greeting.*


**Trainer:** *When a customer requests to proceed with checkout, click on the "Start Sale" button on the register.*


**Trainer:** *After selecting the customer's username, proceed to click on the "Finalize Sale" button.*


**Trainer:** *Based on the guest's preference, click either "Robux Payment" or "Card Payment" to proceed with the payment process.*


**Trainer:** *Afterward, kindly prompt the customer to scan their BloxStreet Cash Card on the payment screen. Once the payment is made, wish the guest an enjoyable rest of their day.*


**Trainer:** *Are all of you prepared to start the test? If you are, please jump to indicate your readiness.*


At this point, all LRs are required to jump. If an LR fails to jump in a timely manner, the trainer must remove them from the server. If any LRs have questions or concerns, trainers should take the time to address them until all LRs are ready to begin. Nevertheless, trainers also have the discretion to proceed if the questions are causing delays and slowing down the group's progress.

**Note: This part is the in-test script.**

**Wait for their greeting.** *Hi, may I please check out my items?*


**Wait for them to say.** *Thank you!*


**If an LR claims their register is not working, check to see if they are signed into another register. If they are, have them sign out of the register. If not, have them roleplay the simulation. Trainers may not fail their LRs if the register is not functioning properly.**

**If they pass, proceed. If they fail, use the line below.**

**Trainer:** *Unfortunately, you have failed this training session due to (reason). You are welcome to attend another session.*



### Passing LRs



**Trainer:** *Congratulations, you have all passed the Register Test! You have each completed both tests.*


**State the line below if there is at least one Senior Team Member remaining in your group.**

**Trainer:** *If you are currently a Senior Team Member, you will be promoted to Department Supervisor. In order to be promoted as a Department Supervisor, you must attend and be recognized at a shift.*


**Trainer:** *Shifts are hosted daily at the store. The entire schedule can be found in the store’s staff room.*


**Trainer:** *If you encounter any trollers at the store, it is necessary to inform an available Store Director+.*


**Trainer:** *For any further inquiries, please make sure to join our communications server using the code 'bloxstreet'.*


**Trainer:** *Please follow me to the purple ranking line so you can be ranked. Congratulations on passing!*


**Trainers should FF their LRs by executing the command /e :ff (username).**

The Host and Co-Host should run the :info command on each LR before kicking. Running the command ensures each LR has been ranked correctly.

After guiding their LRs to a purple ranking line, trainers should leave the Training Center promptly. They should not wait until after their LRs have been ranked. However, if an SHR determines that a photo will take place, trainers should proceed to the lobby, find a seat/stand and remain silent, and follow the SHR's instructions accordingly.


### Training Conclusion

Upon the completion of the training session, there should be no LRs remaining, and only a few HRs should be present. It is crucial for all trainers to leave the server once their training duties are fulfilled. Nothing else should be happening after training sessions. Photos for the Host and Co-Host only are not permitted after training sessions. The Host or an SHR should run the command "/e :shutdown Concluded." to shutdown the server. Additionally, the Co-Host should send the final group shout and submit the training attendance through a ticket.
