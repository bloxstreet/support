# Activity Information 

:::info

Here, HRs can find information about the activity requirement, inactivity notices, and monthly reforms.

:::


### <font color="#C21807">Activity Requirement</font>
- All HRs are required to spend a minimum of 60 minutes per week or 120 minutes every two weeks at the store.

To facilitate activity tracking, we use Hyra. If you haven't already, please sign up for Hyra using [this link](https://app.hyra.io/get-started). HRs who lose their minutes on Hyra are encouraged to create a ticket in the BloxStreet Staffing Support server, making sure to use the format shown in the ticket.


### <font color="#C21807">Inactivity Notices</font>
If an HR is unable to meet an activity requirement or cannot remain active for three or more days, they should create a ticket in the [BloxStreet Staffing Support Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5yfvT5fntP). BloxStreet does not use Hyra for inactivity notices.

__Inactivity Notice Rules:__
- HRs are allowed to have an inactivity notice for a maximum duration of three weeks, and extensions may be granted in genuine cases. 
- All HRs are personally responsible for keeping track of their own inactivity notices.
- During their last day of an inactivity notice, HRs are permitted to claim a spot for themselves to host a session on the following day.
- HRs cannot claim sessions on behalf of other HRs while they are on an inactivity notice.
- During their inactivity notice, HRs can briefly join the game to take a picture, but they are not allowed to join BloxStreet games for any other reasons.
- HRs are authorized to use Jupiter to rank individuals for shifts or demotions while they are on an inactivity notice.
- If an HR wishes to end their inactivity notice earlier than planned, they can reach out to a Staffing Department member. A Staffing Department member must officially approve the end of an inactivity notice before an HR resumes their duties.


### <font color="#C21807">HR Reforms</font>
HR reforms are conducted by BloxStreet's Staffing Department, and they happen once a month at an undisclosed time. During reforms, HRs who have not met the activity requirement will be demoted to the position of Department Supervisor. Additionally, warnings are issued to inactive HRs. Warnings are not a prerequisite for a demotion in the context of reforms. A list of HRs who have received a warning can be found in the pinned messages of [#hr-room](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/600727208155414546). After being demoted, HRs cannot reclaim their previous rank, as doing so will lead to a permanent ban.
