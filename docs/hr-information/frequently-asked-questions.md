# Frequently Asked Questions

:::info

Here, HRs can find answers to frequently asked questions.

:::

### <font color="#C21807">How many HRs can supervise each store department?</font>
A maximum of two HRs may supervise each store department.

### <font color="#C21807">Are HRs required to use grammar?</font>
Grammar is always required in all BloxStreet games and in ban reasons, but it is not mandatory in private servers. Keep in mind that grammar is not required in the BloxStreet Discord server.

### <font color="#C21807">Can HRs go off-duty?</font>
No, HRs may not go off-duty. HRs have additional responsibilities and can order or check out from staff while on-duty.

### <font color="#C21807">If an HR needs to go AFK while in-game, what should they do?</font>
If an HR needs to go AFK while in-game, they must stand against a wall or head to the staff room. If they anticipate being AFK for five or more minutes, they are required to leave the server. Staying AFK for a prolonged period of time will result in a potential punishment.

### <font color="#C21807">What classifies as demanding a promotion?</font>
Demanding a promotion is when a staff member tells an HR to promote them. An example of this would be a staff member saying, "GIVE ME A PROMOTION RIGHT NOW" or "I don't understand why I haven't been promoted after working for six hours. Give me a promotion." If this occurs, be sure to issue a logged warning in [#staff-punishments](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/789513615572729877). If this is their second offense, contact an Executive Assistant+ to issue a demotion. Phrases such as "I've worked for six hours and still haven't been promoted," "Aw man, I worked so hard and didn't get promoted this shift," or "Can I be promoted because I've had this role forever?" are not punishable. If in doubt, HRs should speak to their colleagues in [#hr-room](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/600727208155414546).

### <font color="#C21807">If an HR were to resign or get demoted, can they claim another HR rank again?</font>
Yes, if an HR were to resign or get demoted, they are permitted to claim another HR rank. Note that HRs may not claim the same rank more than once.

### <font color="#C21807">Can HRs purchase items while at the store?</font>
Yes, all HRs are highly encouraged to test LRs’ and MRs’ greetings, provide feedback if necessary, and purchase items at the store.

### <font color="#C21807">What should an HR do if their account is compromised?</font>
In this case, inform a Group Administrator or a Group Director immediately. One will be able to assist the HR.

### <font color="#C21807">Can HRs oversee or supervise at training sessions?</font>
No, HRs can only participate by hosting, co-hosting, or training. Group Administrator+ are the only individuals permitted to oversee training sessions. 

### <font color="#C21807">If an HR wants to know why someone was blacklisted or permanently banned, who can check that?</font>
Ping a Group Administrator or a Group Director with the individual’s username to check for the punishment reason.

### <font color="#C21807">If an HR is unable to attend their scheduled session, what should they do?</font>
If an HR is unable to attend their scheduled session, they must find a suitable replacement as soon as possible. Additionally, they must inform the scheduler immediately in [#session-claiming](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/889200177536196608) about the change.

### <font color="#C21807">Someone claims to have purchased their rank, but Jupiter did not rank them. What should be done?</font>
Instruct the individual to create a ticket in the BloxStreet Discord server. Do not rank the player.

### <font color="#C21807">If a player claims to be demoted without reason, what should an HR do?</font>
If a player claims to have been demoted without a reason, HRs have the ability to investigate the situation by reviewing the demotion reason(s) logged for the LR or MR. This can be done by searching the player's username in [#staff-punishments](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/789513615572729877), where demotion logs for LRs and MRs are typically found. It is important to note that most LR demotions are not logged. In cases where no demotion log is found for the player, it is possible that they have either been blacklisted or permanently banned. To determine if a player is blacklisted or permanently banned, HRs can seek assistance from a Group Administrator or a Group Director.

### <font color="#C21807">What are the rules in private servers?</font>
In BloxStreet private servers, HRs are expected to maintain a professional behavior and adhere to all regulations. It is crucial that HRs do not engage in activities that violate BloxStreet's rules, as they are fully applicable in private servers as well. However, there is no requirement for grammar usage in private servers.
