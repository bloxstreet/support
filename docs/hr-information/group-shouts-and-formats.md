Hosts must use these group shouts and may not modify them.

`üõçÔ∏è [SHIFT] | Hello, everyone! I am now hosting a shift at the store. Staff, this is an opportunity for you to get promoted and earn points. Customers, why not head down to the cafe and get a delectable sandwich? I look forward to seeing everyone there!`

`üõí [SHIFT] | The shift has concluded. Congratulations to everyone who was promoted! If you were unable to attend, do not fret, as there will be several more in the future. Why not head down to the cafe for a custom sandwich?`
