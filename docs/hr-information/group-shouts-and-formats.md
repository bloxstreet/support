# Group Shouts and Formats

:::info

Here, HRs can find the group shouts used for shifts and trainings, as well as important formats.

:::

### <font color="#C21807">Shift Shouts</font>
Hosts must use these group shouts and may not modify them.

`🛍️ [SHIFT] | Hello, everyone! I am now hosting a shift at the store. Staff, this is an opportunity for you to get promoted and earn points. Customers, why not head down to the cafe and get a delectable sandwich? I look forward to seeing everyone there!`

`🛒 [SHIFT] | The shift has concluded. Congratulations to everyone who was promoted! If you were unable to attend, do not fret, as there will be several more in the future. Why not head down to the hotel and book yourself a luxury suite?`

### <font color="#C21807">Training Shouts</font>
Co-Hosts must use the three shouts below and may not modify them. The first shout is the same format announcers must use to announce training sessions in the store.

**Training is Starting:**
`📋 [TRAINING] | A training session will be starting at the Training Center momentarily. Trainee Team Members, Junior Team Members, and Senior Team Members have a chance to rank up.`

**Training is Locked:**
`🔒 [TRAINING] | The training session is now locked. There are plenty of opportunities in the future if you could not attend. In the meanwhile, why not head down to the pharmacy and grab some allergy medicine?`

**Training is Concluded:**
`📋 [TRAINING] | The training session has now concluded. Congratulations to everyone who passed! Why not head down to the store and celebrate? [APPLY] | Interested in working at our establishment? Visit the Quiz Center!`

### <font color="#C21807">Training Attendance Format</font>
To ensure accurate tracking of trainers and training session activity, training attendance is taken. After the completion of a training session, the Co-Host should immediately create a ticket through the [#support](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/1111320732903952478) channel and submit the training attendance log. It is important to spell all usernames correctly and follow the format below, including proper spacing. Please note that failing to submit training attendance within 90 minutes of a session’s start will result in a logged warning.

mm/dd/yyyy @ x AM/PM EST Training Session Attendance
            
	Host: (username)
	Co-Host: (username) - if inapplicable, remove this from the attendance log
  
	Trainer:
	(list usernames vertically)`
