### <font color="#C21807">Conduct at BloxStreet</font>
BloxStreet places great importance on behavior, particularly in our services. Acting unprofessionally can have a negative impact on our establishment and HR team.

__Requirements:__
- All HRs are required to use understandable English in BloxStreet's games and ban reasons.
- All HRs are required to maintain professional conduct.
- All HRs are required to handle situations calmly and to the best of their abilities.
- All HRs should refrain from engaging in off-topic conversations while playing BloxStreet games. HRs are expected to use DMs and chats for such discussions.
- All HRs should refrain from commenting on or questioning a player's demotion.
- All HRs are not allowed to misuse any special permissions, such as the announcement feature.
- A maximum of two HRs may supervise each store department.
- HRs may not go off-duty. HRs have additional responsibilities and can order or check out from staff while on-duty.
- If an HR needs to go AFK while in-game, they must stand against a wall or head to the staff room. If they anticipate being AFK for five or more minutes, they are required to leave the server. Staying AFK for a prolonged period of time will result in a potential punishment.
- If an HR encounters a Group Administrator+ in a BloxStreet game, they should not ask questions or try starting a conversation. Group Administrator+ are not in-game to chat with HRs. If an HR has a question or needs to speak with a Group Administrator+, they should use the Discord server to communicate.

### <font color="#C21807">Uniform Rules</font>
HRs have several clothing options:
- MR/HR Shirt & Tie with the HR badge

### <font color="#C21807">Proper and Improper Usage of the Announcement System</font>
HRs have the option to use the announcement system for promoting a store department, announcing the start of a training session, or requesting staff members at a department. When advertising a store department, HRs should create announcements that demonstrate originality. Do not use the announcements below. It is important to ensure that these advertisements do not disrupt shift or training session announcements.
  
__Acceptable Usages for Announcements:__

`Thirsty? Head down to the cafe to enjoy a refreshing raspberry slushy! Sounds like a wonderful plan to me!`

`More staff members are needed at the pharmacy.`

__Unacceptable Usages for Announcements:__

`Staff members, letâ€™s take a group photo outside!`

`Can another HR teleport to me, please?`

### <font color="#C21807">Professional Conduct Regarding Points</font>
HRs' primary focus at the store should be performing their HR duties as listed on the BloxStreet Support website, not *grinding* points. While *earning* points to rank up is acceptable, HRs should not count down the points needed for a rank, openly flaunt the process of grinding, and congratulate others for ranking up through grinding. This is considered unacceptable and unprofessional. Engaging in these actions will result in disciplinary measures.

### <font color="#C21807">Investigating Demotions</font>
If a player claims to have been demoted without a reason, HRs have the ability to investigate the situation by reviewing the demotion reason(s) logged for the LR or MR. This can be done by searching the player's username in [#staff-punishments](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/789513615572729877), where demotion logs for MRs are typically found. It is important to note that most LR demotions are not logged. In cases where no demotion log is found for the player, it is possible that they have either been blacklisted or permanently banned. To determine if a player is blacklisted or permanently banned, HRs can seek assistance from a Group Administrator or a Group Director.

### <font color="#C21807">Jupiter Ranking</font>
All ranking is conducted through the Jupiter bot, and all HR ranking commands must be executed in [#hr-bots](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/919103544978714634). Executive Assistant+ may rank. To rank someone, type **/setrank** and complete the username and rank fields. For the rank field, HRs can use the rank IDs found in the pinned messages instead of typing the entire rank name. Ranking should only be used for demoting LRs, demoting MRs (with required logging), ranking LRs who were not successfully ranked during training sessions, and promoting at shifts.

### <font color="#C21807">Leaking</font>
Leaking encompasses actions such as sharing screenshots or information from chats, disclosing confidential details, and distributing links to documents that are typically inaccessible to lower ranks within public or private chats. Referencing a confidential chat name in a public chat or disclosing the host or co-host of a session does not fall under the category of leaking. Leaking results in severe consequences, including a demotion to Customer and an unappealable permanent ban. If an HR discovers any instance of leaking by a community member, it is imperative to promptly report the player through a ticket.

### <font color="#C21807">Gossiping</font>
Speaking negatively about someone in the BloxStreet community is considered gossiping. If caught engaging in such behavior, the punishment is a permanent ban and a ban from BloxStreet Discord servers.

### <font color="#C21807">Discussions of Suicide and Self-Harm</font>
Avoid discussing topics related to suicide and self-harm within the BloxStreet Discord server and in-game, as this can be distressing for many individuals. Mentioning these topics will lead to an immediate termination and permanent ban. The majority of BloxStreet members are teenagers or young adults, making members unqualified to provide assistance. Instead, BloxStreet encourages HRs to reach out to a professional or a trusted individual for support. If an HR is unable to do both, the suicide hotline or the Samaritans are open 24/7. BloxStreet encourages HRs to browse this website to make themselves familiar with the [suicide hotline for their country](https://blog.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines/). Keep in mind that HRs have the option of taking a break from BloxStreet by going on an inactivity notice.

### <font color="#C21807">Private Server Rules</font>
In BloxStreet private servers, HRs are expected to maintain a professional behavior and adhere to all regulations. It is crucial that HRs do not engage in activities that violate BloxStreet's rules, as they are fully applicable in private servers as well.

### <font color="#C21807">Resignations</font>
If an HR decides to step down from their position, they have two options for resigning: they can either leave BloxStreet's group or request a Group Administrator or a Group Director to rank them to Customer. Once an HR has departed the group, they gain the ability to update their roles in the Discord server by simply executing the command **/getrole** in any channel used to run commands. Keep reactions to resignations appropriate, thanking an individual for their service and time spent at BloxStreet while also refraining from exaggerated reactions. While community members are permitted to inquire about the reasons behind an HR's resignation, it is ultimately at the HR's discretion to decide whether they want to disclose their reason(s) appropriately.

### <font color="#C21807">Joking about Resignations</font>
HRs are expected to maintain a high level of professionalism, including in Discord chat channels. Joking about resignations as an HR can come across as unprofessional and insensitive, undermining the seriousness of their role and responsibilities. Therefore, any jokes about resignations are strictly prohibited and will result in a forced resignation by a Group Administrator or Group Director, effectively a demotion to Customer.
