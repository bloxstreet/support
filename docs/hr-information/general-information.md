### <font color="#C21807">Conduct at BloxStreet</font>
BloxStreet places great importance on behavior, particularly in our services. Acting unprofessionally can have a negative impact on our establishment and HR team.

__Expectations:__
- All HRs are expected to use grammar in BloxStreet's games and ban reasons.
- All HRs are expected to maintain professional conduct.
- All HRs are expected to handle situations calmly and to the best of their abilities.
- All HRs should refrain from engaging in off-topic conversations while playing BloxStreet games. HRs are expected to use DMs and chats for such discussions.
- All HRs should refrain from commenting on or questioning a player's demotion.
- All HRs are not allowed to misuse any special permissions, such as the announcement feature.

### <font color="#C21807">Professional Conduct Regarding Points</font>
- As an HR, your primary focus at the store should be performing your HR duties as listed on the BloxStreet Support website, not *grinding* points.
- While *earning* points to rank up is acceptable, counting down the points you need for a rank, openly flaunting the process of grinding, and congratulating others for ranking up through grinding are considered unacceptable and unprofessional behaviors.
- Engaging in these actions will result in disciplinary measures.

### <font color="#C21807">Uniform Rules</font>
HRs have several clothing options:
- MR/HR Shirt & Tie with the HR badge
- MR/HR Shirt & Tie without the HR badge 
- BloxStreet hoodies or uniforms

HRs may not wear casual clothing with the HR badge.

__Allowed:__
- Leg warmers or socks past the knees
- Dark tights
- Fishnets
- Shirts past the HR badge
- Pants halfway down the thigh

__Not Allowed:__
- Big cut-outs

### <font color="#C21807">Communication at BloxStreet</font>

__Leaking:__
- Leaking encompasses actions such as sharing screenshots or information from chats, disclosing confidential details, and distributing links to documents that are typically inaccessible to lower ranks within public or private chats.
- Referencing a confidential chat name in a public chat or disclosing the host or co-host of a session does not fall under the category of leaking.
- Leaking results in severe consequences, including a demotion to Customer and an unappealable permanent ban.
- If an HR discovers any instance of leaking by a community member, it is imperative to promptly report the player through a ticket.

__Gossiping:__
- Speaking negatively about someone in the BloxStreet community is considered gossiping.
- If caught engaging in such behavior, the punishment is a permanent ban and a ban from BloxStreet Discord servers.

__Discussions of Suicide and Self-Harm:__
- Avoid discussing topics related to suicide and self-harm within the BloxStreet Discord server and in-game, as this can be distressing for many individuals. Mentioning these topics will lead to an immediate termination and permanent ban.
- The majority of BloxStreet members are teenagers or young adults, making members unqualified to provide assistance. Instead, BloxStreet encourages you to reach out to a professional or a trusted individual for support.
- If you are unable to do both, the suicide hotline or the Samaritans are open 24/7. BloxStreet encourages you to browse this website to make yourself familiar with the [suicide hotline for your country](https://blog.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines/).

For the United States, **988** is the nationwide suicide hotline number. 
For the United Kingdom, **0800 689 5652** is the hotline number. 

Please keep in mind that HRs have the option of taking a break from BloxStreet by going on an inactivity notice.


### <font color="#C21807">Proper and Improper Usage of the Announcement System</font>
- HRs have the option to use the announcement system for promoting a store department, announcing the start of a training session, or requesting staff members at a department.
- When advertising a store department, HRs should create announcements that demonstrate outstanding grammar and originality. Do not use the announcements below.
- It is important to ensure that these advertisements do not disrupt shift or training session announcements.
  
__Acceptable Usages for Announcements:__

`Thirsty? Head down to the cafe to enjoy a refreshing raspberry slushy! Sounds like a wonderful plan to me!`

`More staff members are needed at the pharmacy.`

__Unacceptable Usages for Announcements:__

`Staff members, letâ€™s take a group photo outside!`

`Can another HR teleport to me, please?`


### <font color="#C21807">Resignations</font>
- If an HR decides to step down from their position, they have two options for resigning: they can either leave BloxStreet's group or request a Group Administrator or a Group Director to rank them to Customer.
- Once an HR has departed the group, they gain the ability to update their roles in the Discord server by simply executing the command **/getrole** in any channel used to run commands.
- Please keep reactions to resignations appropriate, thanking an individual for their service and time spent at BloxStreet while also refraining from exaggerated reactions.
- While community members are permitted to inquire about the reasons behind an HR's resignation, it is ultimately at the HR's discretion to decide whether they want to disclose their reason(s) appropriately.

### <font color="#C21807">Joking about Resignations</font>
- As HRs, we expect you to maintain a high level of professionalism, including in Discord chat channels.
- Joking about resignations can come across as unprofessional and insensitive, undermining the seriousness of your role and responsibilities.
- Therefore, any jokes about resignations are strictly prohibited and will result in a forced resignation by a Group Administrator or Group Director, effectively a demotion to Customer.
