### <font color="#C21807">Conduct at BloxStreet</font>
At BloxStreet, we place great importance on behavior, particularly in our services. Acting unprofessionally can have a negative impact on our establishment and HR team.

- All HRs are expected to maintain professional conduct.

### <font color="#C21807">Communication at BloxStreet</font>

__Leaking:__
- Leaking encompasses actions such as sharing screenshots or information from chats, disclosing confidential details, and distributing links to documents that are typically inaccessible to lower ranks within public or private chats.
- Referencing a confidential chat name in a public chat or disclosing the host or co-host of a session does not fall under the category of leaking.
- Leaking results in severe consequences, including a demotion to Customer and an unappealable permanent ban.
- If an HR discovers any instance of leaking by a community member, it is imperative to promptly report the player through a ticket.

__Gossiping:__
- Gossiping refers to hate speech (racism, transphobia, homophobia, etc...), cyberbullying an individual (where we have evidence that it is consistent, not a one off comment), defamation (attempting to create a scandal or damage an individual's reputation through the sharing of altered evidence or incorrect information), wishing or threatening physical or mental harm, or doxxing/leaking and sharing of personal information.
- If caught engaging in such behavior, the punishment varies and will be decided by Group Administrators and Group Directors.

__Discussions of Suicide and Self-Harm:__
- Avoid discussing topics related to suicide and self-harm within the BloxStreet Discord server and in-game, as this can be distressing for many individuals. Mentioning these topics will lead to an immediate termination and permanent ban.
- The majority of BloxStreet members are teenagers or young adults, so we are not qualified to provide assistance. Instead, we encourage you to reach out to a professional or a trusted individual for support.
- If you are unable to do both, the suicide hotline or the Samaritans are open 24/7. We encourage you to browse this website to make yourself familiar with the [suicide hotline for your country](https://blog.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines/).

For the United States, **988** is the nationwide suicide hotline number. 
For the United Kingdom, **0800 689 5652** is the hotline number. 

Please keep in mind that HRs have the option of taking a break from BloxStreet by going on an inactivity notice.


### <font color="#C21807">Proper and Improper Usage of the Announcement System</font>
- HRs have the option to use the announcement system for promoting a store department, announcing the start of a training session, or requesting staff members at a department.
- When advertising a store department, HRs should create announcements that demonstrate outstanding grammar and originality.
- It is important to ensure that these advertisements do not disrupt shift or training session announcements.
- We request refraining from making announcements 15 minutes prior to the commencement of any training session.

__Acceptable Usages for Announcements:__

`Thirsty? Head down to the cafe to enjoy a refreshing raspberry slushy! Sounds like a wonderful plan to me!`

`More staff members are needed at the pharmacy.`

__Unacceptable Usages for Announcements:__

`Staff members, letâ€™s take a group photo outside!`

`Can another HR teleport to me, please?`


### <font color="#C21807">Resignations</font>
- If an HR decides to step down from their position, they have two options for resigning: they can either leave BloxStreet's group or request an SHR to rank them to Customer.
- Once an HR has departed the group, they gain the ability to update their roles in the Discord server by simply executing the command **/getrole** in any channel used to run commands.
- Please keep reactions to resignations appropriate, thanking an individual for their service and time spent at BloxStreet while also refraining from exaggerated reactions.
- While community members are permitted to inquire about the reasons behind an HR's resignation, it is ultimately at the HR's discretion to decide whether they want to disclose their reason(s) appropriately.
