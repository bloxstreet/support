### <font color="#C21807">Claiming Shifts and Training Sessions: Information and Formats</font>

To claim a shift or training session, HRs are required to use the provided formats and post their claim(s) in the [#session-claiming](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/889200177536196608) channel at **5:00 PM EST**. HRs who cannot claim sessions at this time are encouraged to visit the [Claiming Exception Requests thread](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/1177015340803293184). If you are unable to access the thread, you are encouraged to contact an SHR. When an HR claims a shift or training session, they are reserving it for the following day. For instance, if an HR claims a shift at 5:00 PM EST today, they will be hosting that shift tomorrow.

**Shift Claiming Format:**

`Host’s Username:`<br />
`Ranker’s Username:`<br />
`Shift Date & Time:`

All HRs have the option to host shifts. Only individuals who hold the rank of Executive Assistant or higher are granted ranking privileges. As a result, Store Directors must have a ranker available for their shift before claiming. The ranker does not necessarily have to be in the store to perform their duties. It is the ranker's responsibility to be online and available when the Store Director is hosting their shift. In the case of Executive Assistants or Store Executives hosting a shift, they should exclude the 'Ranker's Username:' portion from the claiming message, as they are capable of ranking themselves.

**Training Claiming Format:**

`Host’s Username:`<br />
`Co-Host’s Username:`<br />
`Training Date & Time:`

Executive Assistants and Store Executives are permitted to host training sessions. Co-Hosts are not required. If one of these ranks is hosting a training independently, they should exclude the 'Co-Host's Username' portion from the claiming message. To request a co-host, HRs must add one when claiming a session. Adding a co-host after claiming a session is not allowed.

### <font color="#C21807">Claiming Shifts and Training Sessions: Rules</font>

- Executive Assistant+ may only host/co-host trainings twice a day.
- Store Director+ can only host shifts once a day. Store Directors need a ranker.
- Any claim submitted before 5:00 PM EST will not be accepted.
- Edited claims will not be accepted.
- There may only be one claim per message.
- The spelling of usernames or an incorrect date do not matter.
- HRs on an inactivity notice cannot claim for other HRs.
- HRs on an inactivity notice cannot claim for themselves until it is the final day of their notice.
- Anyone can claim for HRs on the claiming exceptions list if the HR has agreed to a session.

If an HR's claim is approved, an SHR will indicate approval with a ✅ reaction. If declined, an SHR will use an ❎ reaction. Arguments about claiming will not be tolerated. An SHR will announce the schedule for the following day between 5:00 PM and 11:30 PM EST.

Note that it is crucial to follow through on claimed shifts and training sessions. If an HR claims a shift or training session but becomes unable to host, they themselves are responsible for finding a replacement and informing the scheduler in [#session-claiming](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/889200177536196608), making sure to provide a reason. Repeated instances of claiming without hosting or transferring sessions may lead to consequences.


### <font color="#C21807">Basic Shift Information</font>
- Shifts offer opportunities for Department Supervisors, Department Managers, and Assistant Store Managers to receive a promotion.
- Shifts also serve as times for guests to visit the store and have an enjoyable experience.
- Shift hosts are responsible for ensuring a successful shift by supervising, ensuring staff members have detailed and courteous greetings, and recognizing outstanding performance by promoting individuals.
- Shifts should be claimed at xx:00. Shifts can be claimed at xx:10 at the latest. A shift cannot be claimed after this time.

### <font color="#C21807">Promoting at Shifts</font>
During a shift, the host is permitted to promote Department Supervisors, Department Managers, and Assistant Store Managers. Store Managers, however, are ineligible for a promotion during shifts, although their contributions during shifts are still appreciated.

__During the shift at the store, the host should consider the following before promoting individuals:__
- Staff members who have recently viewed or followed the shift host or complained recently should be excluded from promotion consideration.
- Professionalism, politeness, respect, hard work, excellent grammar, and unique greetings are required for MRs seeking a promotion.
- The host should attempt to check all store departments.
- The host has the option to approach players and engage with them by checking out or ordering an item.

If a player meets all the previously mentioned requirements, the host may proceed to promote them.

Hosts should conduct shift promotions in a professional manner, wherein they directly approach staff members, extend their congratulations, and refrain from resorting to misleading or foolish tactics. Anything resembling "We've caught you behaving unprofessionally, and you will be demoted!" or "What starts with a p and ends with an n?" is strictly forbidden. Please be direct when conveying your intent to promote a staff member. After congratulating the promoted staff member, the host should provide them with brief information regarding their new rank responsibilities. The host should then instruct the staff member to rejoin the game for their new rank.

It is important to note that the host is limited to promoting a maximum of **5** players per shift. Promotions should be viewed as a privilege rather than a right, and the host has the discretion to choose not to promote anyone if no staff members have surpassed their expectations. Additionally, there should only be one host during a shift. No other individuals may offer assistance, follow the host, or supervise the host.

### <font color="#C21807">Step-By-Step Claiming</font>

1. Equip the Staff Tablet located in your inventory.
2. Once you equip the tablet, click the menu icon and go to "Shifts."
3. Click the "Start Shift" button.

Only HRs who are scheduled to host a shift may claim it in-game.


### <font color="#C21807">Joining and Leaving During a Shift</font>
- Before an HR decides to claim a shift at the store, it is important for them to have a stable internet connection and the ability to remain in-game for a minimum of 35 minutes. If a host is unable to stay for the entire duration of the shift, they should refrain from claiming it.
- Shifts always conclude at :30.
- HRs who leave a shift after promoting five players will face consequences. HRs may only leave once the shift has concluded.
