# TSA Admin Guide

1. TOC

TSA is BloxStreet's administrative system and anti-exploit, custom developed by axcracy and TheCakeChicken. TSA takes the form of a Discord bot, Roblox module, and administrative web panel. Those with TSA permissions can utilize these to perform their duties.

### Commands
{: .text-red-300 }
#### 1A - Permission Levels
{: .text-grey-dk-000 }
{: .no_toc }
All members who are ranked Store Supervisor+ will gain access to various commands. Ranks and their respective admin levels are shown below. 

| Rank        | Admin Level         | 
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Store Supervisor           | Moderator | 
| Assistant Manager | Moderator   | 
| Store Manager           | Moderator     | 
| Store Director          | Admin | 
| Board of Directors          | Admin | 
| Executive Assistant           | Admin | 
| Store Executive         | Admin | 
| Junior Moderator           | Super Admin | 
| Senior Moderator          | Super Admin | 
| Head Moderator           | Super Admin | 
| Store Developer          | Creator | 
| Group Owner           | Creator | 

Depending on the role, certain commands can be executed. For example, users with Moderator commands **cannot** run :pban. However, players with Super Admin may.

#### 1B - Executing Commands
{: .text-grey-dk-000 }
{: .no_toc }
When executing commands, ensure they are being utilized correctly. 

* TSA provides the ability to hide commands by typing "/e" in front of them.
  * To run a command privately with the "/e" method, open up the chat to run a command per usual. After doing so, place a "/e" before the desired command.
    * EX:  **_/e :m Hello!_**
  * This will make the command private. This also makes the command hidden from the chat.
* The console can also be used to carry out a command. 
  * To use the console, press ";" or "'" on your keyboard. This will prompt a GUI to appear at the top of your screen. When using the console, the prefix is **not** required. 
    * EX: ; (Console Opens) 
      
      **_exploitlogs_**

      (Exploit logs GUI is then shown as expected) 
      
### Anti-Exploit
{: .text-red-300 }
As mentioned at the start of this document, TSA features a built-in anti-exploit system, which keeps out exploiters. The anti-exploit system automatically permanently bans or kicks depending on the severity. 

* All detected exploits can be viewed with the :exploitlogs command. **Please do not stay under the impression that :exploitlogs will show exploiters who are currently in the server and show what they are doing. The system cannot detect everything and only logs when an exploiter is automatically banned.** 
* If a player appears in :exploitlogs, there is no need to request in-game assistance, as the exploiter may have already been banned by TSA's anti-exploit. However, if an exploiter is present, contact an available HR. If possible, gather sufficient evidence and open a ticket as well. 

### Downtime
{: .text-red-300 }
Downtime is a time in which a critical error has occurred within the code, stopping all commands being run, and by extension, your admin being given.

Click [here](https://status.bloxstreet.store) to view the status of various TSA services.

* In this scenario, the Head Moderators+ kindly request that **players do not spam ping us, DM us repeatedly, or anything of the sort when this occurs.** Doing so is **_punishable_** and can lead to consequences. Group Developers have likely been informed of the problems and are working diligently to fix them. 
* A simple fix may just be rejoining. If a server shuts down, many players rejoining at the same time can overload the system and may cause admin loading to be delayed. For this reason, we request that players **wait a few minutes** before rejoining.

### Acceptable Usage
{: .text-red-300 }
This is the main section of the document. It will outline the acceptable and unacceptable usages of admin commands.

All major admin abuse (running :pban all, etc.) is **logged** and will result in an instant punishment! The command will be immediately canceled, and SHRs will be notified.

#### 4A - All Commands Usage
{: .text-grey-dk-000 }
{: .no_toc }

When executing commands, be sure to type at least 50% of the player's username.


| Command Name | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| :respawn / :res / :refresh / :ref | Use this command to respawn yourself and anybody who may request it. You may NOT do :respawn all or respawn users who do not request a respawn. |
| :kick (Store Director+) | Use this command to update in-game ranks, kick failed or passed LRs at a training session, or for any other valid reason. |
| :ban (Store Director+) | Use this command for trollers, rule violators, removing a blacklisted or permanently banned user, or for  other valid reason. |
| :unban (Store Director+) | Use this command if an HR accidentally bans the wrong person or if an invalid ban reason was put. | 
| :pban (Junior Moderator+) | Use this command to permanently ban players (valid reasons are on the Punishment Guide). | 
| :sm / :m  / :fm (Junior Moderator+) | Use this command to make announcements in the store or at training sessions. | 
| :shutdown (Junior Moderator+ & the host of a training) | Use this command to conclude a training session after everyone is finished. SHRs may use this command if several players are banned from a server as a result of an admin abuse attack, for development updates, or if a server is lagging and nonfunctional. This command may not be used without valid reasoning. |
| :slock / unslock (Host of a training session) | Use this command to lock a training session at :00. This command should not be used to unlock a server during a training session. |

| :to | Use this command to be teleported to another player, as well as for other valid reasons. |
| :view / :unview | Use this command to watch suspicious players (example: exploiters). Do not use this command to stalk SHRs or view shift hosts. | 
| :ff / :unff | Use this command for LRs who pass a training session and need to be taken to the ranking line. | 
| :fly (Junior Moderator+) | SHRs should use this command to supervise the store or a training session. |
