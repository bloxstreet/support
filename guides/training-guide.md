* Hosts are required to select a trusted HR to announce training at the store.
* Trainers should not rush through the script. Allow your LRs to have time to read the information you’re providing them.

## Host Scripts
{: .text-red-300 }
This section outlines what the duties the host has and what they should say. Do not follow this section if you are not the Host/Co-Host.

### Host: Claiming
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

At :30, the Host, the Co-Host, and the rankers should join the Training Center to prepare for the session. Trainers (Store Managers and HRs) should not join until :40.

To claim the session, click the message at the top of the screen that says “Click here to host one!”. A GUI will pop up with a button that says “Claim” on it. **Please read the information first on that GUI.** Once you have pressed "Claim," the message that says “No training is being hosted right now. Check back later!” on the screen will be removed, and the session will become active. 

At :40, the Co-Host should do the first shout on the group page. The group shout templates are located in a designated area. 

**_NOTE: AFTER YOU HAVE CLAIMED IN-GAME, YOU CANNOT LEAVE THE SERVER, OR YOU WILL RECEIVE CONSEQUENCES! DO NOT CLAIM IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE HAVING INTERNET RELATED ISSUES, THAT MIGHT MEAN YOU GET DISCONNECTED, ETC._** 


### Host: After Claiming
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

As the LRs join the server, be sure to encourage them to enter the building and stand on the red lines.

**Host:** *Welcome to all of our staff members joining! Please enter the building and stand on the red lines. Your trainer will answer any questions that you might have.*

You should keep saying the line above until the start time. Do not spam it… use it when necessary.
The Host and Co-Host near the escalator... on their designated line. LRs are expected to enter the building and stand on the red lines.

### Host/Co-Host: Training Starts
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

At :00, the LRs should quietly stand on the red lines, and the MRs/HRs should be at their stations. The Host should use /e :slock to stop more LRs from joining, and the Co-Host should post the second group shout. The group shout templates are located in a designated area.

**Host:** *Greetings, everyone! Welcome to today’s training session! My name is (username), and I am your host.*

**Co-Host:** *Hello, everyone! My name is (username), and I am your co-host for today’s training session. I wish you the best of luck.*

**Co-Host:** *Before we commence, I ask everyone to remain silent at all times. You will be watching a presentation before being trained.*

**Host:** *The presentation lasts a few minutes, and we request that you give it your full attention. This presentation teaches you vital information for your success.*

**Co-Host:** *Please note that speaking or distracting others is prohibited during this time, and you will be removed from the server if caught doing so.* 

The host and co-host will stand and monitor the LRs and the presentation to ensure everything runs smoothly.

To begin the presentation, the Host must press the “Host Settings” button at the bottom left corner of their screen, and then press the button that says ‘Begin’. **If the “Host Settings” button is not appearing on the bottom left corner, the Host should rejoin immediately. The slideshow can only be played once. Be sure to inform the LRs that they can click on the monitors to get a better view.**

### Host/Co-Host: After Presentation
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

Once the presentation concludes, LRs are required to remain silent for the host’s instructions.

**Host:** *Thank you for paying attention during the presentation. You will now receive further instructions about this training.*

**LRs WILL CONTINUE STANDING ON THE RED LINES AFTER THE PRESENTATION HAS ENDED.**

**Co-Host:** *LRs, please remain on the red lines. You will be teleported to a trainer when one is available.*

**Host:** *On behalf of all MRs and HRs here, I wish you the best of luck in passing this training session. Trainers, please be patient until your LRs are teleported to you.*

**At this point, the Host will teleport LRs to trainers. Try to keep an eye on where the LRs are to ensure you don’t teleport someone currently being trained.**

**Anybody who decides to idle during training should be kicked.**


## Trainer Scripts
{: .text-red-300 }
This section will outline each of the tests the trainers are expected to perform.

### Grammar/Greeting Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

For the Grammar/Greeting Test, as a trainer, you must explain how this test works. Have your group of LRs show their greetings to you. **IMPORTANT: Do not fail LRs for minor grammatical errors. If you can understand their greetings easily, you should pass them.** You are always welcome to give out tips if needed. Make sure to give them a tip on copying and pasting their greeting every time, as it makes things much quicker on their behalf. If they pass, continue to the next test.  If they fail, kick them from the server and explain why.

### Cafe Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

The next part of training is the Cafe Test. In this test, you will ask your LRs for any available drink. Wait for them to make it and say “Of course," or something related to that. LRs must have understandable grammar in this test. Ensure that LRs know about the slush machine and the fact it has different flavors that can be selected once a COLD CUP is touched.

### Restocking Explanation

### Passing LRs
{: .text-purple-100 }

**Trainer:** *During this training, I will be teaching you the basics that every Low Rank should know. I will also be providing important information for your success.*

**Trainer:** *If you need to go AFK for any reason, please make sure to tell me. Failure to do so will result in a removal from the server.*

**Trainer:** *If I happen to disconnect, please wait until I rejoin. Do NOT move to a different station.*

**Trainer:** *If you disconnect from the server, you may attend the next training session. The schedule of our training sessions can be found in the staff room, which is located in the store.*

**Trainer:** *Does anyone have any questions? A response from every Trainee is mandatory.*

At this point, you must wait for the Trainee to respond. If they reply with a positive answer, implying that they are ready to proceed, move on. If not, answer any questions they may have until they are ready to begin.

## Training Conclusion
{: .text-red-300 }
Once the training has ended, there should be no LRs left in the server and very few MRs or HRs. All trainers **should’ve left the server** after they’ve finished training. If there are people left, encourage them to leave to go to the store. **Absolutely nothing else should be happening after training sessions. Do not sit around giving feedback as it is unnecessary. Have an SHR do :place all if there are a lot of people still in the server or just shutdown.**


Leave the game when finished training or once you have been ranked. Do not do anything else.


At the end of training, the Co-Host should post the last group shout. The group shout templates are located in a designated area. 


**_If a Junior Moderator+ chooses to take a photo at the conclusion of the session, follow their directions._**
