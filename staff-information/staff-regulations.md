Below is a list of conduct regulations all staff members are expected to comply with. Failure to follow the regulations below will result in consequences. Keep in mind that the rules below are only a portion of the many guidelines staff members are expected to follow.

## Uniforms

All staff members are required to wear an official BloxStreet uniform while on duty. Staff members may equip a uniform by interacting with a locker and selecting their desired uniform.
  
  Things to keep in mind:
  *  Refusal to wear a uniform will result in consequences.
  *  BloxStreet merchandise from the group’s store IS acceptable as long as the uniform is up to date. 
  *  Uniforms with a Target logo are considered outdated.

## In-Game Conduct

  *  Professionalism is required while in public eye. Behaving unprofessionally reflects badly on our group.
  *  LRs and MRs are to work while at the store while on duty. Staff members who mess around at the store will receive consequences. If a staff member wishes to converse with others and/or take a break from their general duties, they should go off duty.
  *  Players who choose to act unprofessionally while off duty will be subject to the same consequences one would receive while on duty.
  *  Staff members may NOT go idle in the middle of the store. If a staff member wishes to go idle, they may respawn into the staff room by resetting their character.
  *  LRs and MRs may NOT interact with trollers; instead, consult with an HR official, as they are trained to handle certain situations.
  *  Staff members are expected to comply with orders issued by an HR+ official. Failure to comply with certain orders will result in consequences.
  *  Abusing admin, the warning system, cuffs, or any permissions will result in consequences.

## General Conduct
{: .text-red-300 } 

  *  Respect all decisions made by SHRs. If a player has a question or concern regarding a decision made by a Senior High Rank, they may consult with one through a ticket.
  *  Do not instigate drama, regardless of whether the other player is at fault. If a player has an issue with a fellow staff member,  it should be reported to a Junior Moderator+ privately. Keep all personal drama OUT of the staff team.
  *  Administrative action is FINAL. Any questions or concerns regarding administrative action inflicted upon a player should be directed through a TICKET. Complaining about administrative action will only lead to further consequences.
  *  Staff members are expected to remain professional at both affiliated and non-affiliated establishments. Failure to do so will result in consequences.
  *  Professionalism must be maintained to a certain degree within the communications server. Staff members are more than welcome to converse with one another, but all topics must be appropriate and within reason.
