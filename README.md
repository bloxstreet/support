## Contributing?
When contributing, ensure that you keep the style consistent with the other pages of the website.
- Wording should be kept short and simple, no need to overcomplicate things.
- Introductions should go directly under the page title, without a subheading.
- There should be no more than one # tag per page. All sub headings should use ##.
- Unsure of the Markdown syntax? Click [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs) for documentation.
